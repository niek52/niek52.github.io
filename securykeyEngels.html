            <h2 id="secKeyheadersh">3. Product description:</h2>


            <p id="secKeyheaders">The SecuryKey_mate version is the first product of our company. This USB with RAM has a chance to revolutionize
                the use of portable storage devices. It will be using Ram memory, a battery and a mini-PC. Because of the
                combination of RAM memory and USB 3.2 we will be able to read and write data about 20 times faster than a
                normal USB-drive. We also use a lesser used feature of RAM memory: if you turn of the power of your device
                all the data is automatically wiped. This is very useful for the military/financial practices were you can’t
                have the risk of data falling in the wrong hands. The SecuryKey_summa version is the second version. This
                version has an integrated wifi network that enables the user to share data with everyone that is connected
                to the network. This item could be of use in multiple occaisions. For example, when several people need to
                see the same information in a meeting. instead of using something like github, google, docs they just have
                to connect and download the files that are on the USB.
            </p>

        <h2 id="secKeyheadersh">5. Additional value to society</h2>
        <p id="secKeyheaders">

            The securykey_mate is developed in a way that’s it affordable for practically, everyone. Everybody who needs to transport
            huge amounts of data should be able to use and afford this just fine, its development provides security to either
            businessman, that carry around sensitive company data, or just the regular household who don’t want their private
            data to be exposed to the public. The somewhat older generation that missed the whole “cloud” thing can also
            find practical use for this, this way of transporting data will be “revived” for them since they only had this
            transportation method back then.

        </br>
        <h2 id="secKeyheadersh">6. Target group</h2>
        <p id="secKeyheaders">The groups that we want to sell our product to are mainly military and financial because of the kind of data they
            work with. But also tech savvy people can benefit from this product because of the speeds that can be acquired.
            And everybody got some things they want to store that they don't want the rest of the world to see.

                <!--<p id="p9"><h1 id="experience"></h1>
					<h3 id="h3artikel">Experience 1</h3>
					<p id="artikelparagrafen">2 years ago, I went camping to the Ardennes with some of my friends.
						 We had a good time but we weren’t the only ones there. There were 2 major groups of people enjoying
						  their stay on the campsite, Belgians and Dutch people. One of the things we noticed about the Dutch 
						  people was the fact that they are way more direct in the things they want to say. We felt that they didn’t care about how people react to their words even tough they might be nice people. We personally didn’t feel offended at all cause we know some Dutch people ourselves and know that the things they say aren’t meant to hurt people but rather to help them. For example when girl’s dress doesn’t look nice on her we mostly are to ashamed or to afraid to tell her directly and we might even lie and say she looks stunning. Dutch people on the other hand I felt like they just say what they think about it even tough the person they are talking to might get hurt in the process. This might cause some major conflicts between Dutch people and for example Chinese people where respect is very important.</p>
					
					<h3 id="h3artikel">Experience 2</h3>
					<p id="artikelparagrafen">My second experience was when I went to the ‘De Gentse Feesten’. I was partying with my friends but because there were to many people there I lost them in the crowd.
						 I just bought myself some new beverages but because of all the people I accidentaly spilled some of my beer on one of the girls. I wanted to appolagize and wipe of the spilled beer but all of the sudden her boyfriend starts yelling at me. I asked why he was so upset about the fact that I was just trying to be friendly and helpful.
						  It was a man from turkisch origin and said I looked at his girlfriend and then tried some very inappropriate things without asking. I explained the situation to which he replied pretty aggressively and told me he was even mad that I just looked at her. It escalated to a conflict which attracted a lot of his friends who wanted to start a fight. I knew I didn’t stand a chance because I lost my friends but even when I would win the conflict, violence is never an option. It makes everything worse but I think that in their culture looking at a girl without asking her or trying to get her attention without her asking is more offensive than ours. This can cause a lot of conflicts if the communication isn’t on point which it definitely wasn’t cause of the loud</p>
