						 Step1: Deciding the hypothisis<br/>
						 <br>
						Countries with a high power don’t discuss the decission’s from people higher on the social ladder. Their boss for example. Countries on the other hand with a low power distance aren’t afraid to speak up when their oppinions differnciate from the ones of their bosses.
						<br/>
						 						<br/>
						 Step2: Doing research to support the hypothisis<br/>
						<br>
						I’ve compared 2 countries: <strong>Malaysia and Austria.</strong>
						
						<h4>Explanation:</h4></br>
						
					<p>Malaysia does have one of the highest power differnces in the world. The reason for this is the fact that they’re leaning towards dictatorship. They’re willing to follow 1 perticular person in all of his decisicions without discussion. Another reason for this is their low indivualism and a rather low Masculinity level. They’re not that driven to achieve higher goals in life which we can decide from the low individualism. A countrie with high masculinity is usually known for trying to be the best.This is the case for Austria. It’s the oposite from Malaysia where people dare to disagree and ry to achieve higher goals in life. I’ve done my research and found an article about Malaysia leaning towards a dictatorship.

			</h4>
			<!--<h1>Wat meer over mezelf</h1>-->
			<p id="p9">
					
			
				The article we’ve chosen is one about the major part of the movie, drugs. This article tells us about a man calles Bas, twenty years old, who has quit his best-payed job of his live. It’s no secret that a lot of teenagers end up in the most dangerous world, the drugsindustry, most of them as dealers, some of them make drugs their own but most of them  start dealing drugs. The most important reason is the fact that they all want to earn money, quick and easy so that they can become real ‘Patsers’. Most of them don’t realise once you get involved in this bussiness it’s real hard to get out of it. The dealers threaten their families, loved ones or they make sure most of the dealers also get addicted to the drugs they deal. If they don’t deal for money the will surely deal to get their hands on, what they call in Atwerp the white gold, some of the drugs. A lot of people also don’t realise that there are a lot of conscecences to dealing drugs. They are young and think they won’t get caught cause their so called bosses know very well how to convince these naïve teens. When they do get caught they won’t be in jail for a long period of time cause most of them start at a young age but what some of them don’t get that they have to keep dealing drugs even when they are matured, with other words plus 18, and it’s then when most of their miserie begins. They can’t tell the authorities cause their drugsbosses make sure they know enough about the person and their familie, where they live,what their hobby’s are etc., that when they want to tell the police for example, they cant cause they know their familie will get killed or punished. 
					The article tells us about the fact that when they lock people up for dealing drugs, it’s not really effective and might even cause more problems because there are a lot of contact in prison which might cause them to even get more involved in the drugindustrie. 
					It also causes for people to lose a lot of their friends, cause nobody likes a drugsdealer. They don’t want to get involved in the other person’s miserie etc. This was clearly shown in the movie. It was a small group of friends who completely trusted each other and would do anything for each other.
					One of the major reason’s why people start to deal drugs is the fact that they think they don’t have anything to lose. This is a big cultural difference because we so called ‘white people’ don’t have to deal with racism. On the other hand you have the turkisch, albanian, marroccan people do have to deal with racism. Most of the time society doesn’t accept them fully which makes them very unstable and become an easy target to the drugs. They tell them society doesn’t accept them, they want to earn a lot of money, multiple times shown in the movie. A way to prevent this from happening is either to stop the bosses and not only the dealers, get rid of the whole industry but his might be a bit of a hefty goal, or we can provide a support system for everyone who wants to get out of the industry. Also when they get out of jail, they normally cant go anywhere and they usually fall back in their old habits cause that’s the only think they know and think they’re good at. It’s there where we can easily act and we should act more.
					
					What we can decide out of the movie and this article is the fact that we have to make sure we have to accept everyone equally, have to battle against racism, never get involved in drugs cause it’s very dangerous and has a lot of conscequences and provide systems that people can use to get out of this horrible industry.

			<!--<h1>Wat meer over mezelf</h1>-->
			<p id="p9"><h1 id="experience">2 EXPERIENCES</h1>
					<h3 id="h3artikel">Experience 1</h3>
					<p id="artikelparagrafen">2 years ago, I went camping to the Ardennes with some of my friends.
						 We had a good time but we weren’t the only ones there. There were 2 major groups of people enjoying
						  their stay on the campsite, Belgians and Dutch people. One of the things we noticed about the Dutch 
						  people was the fact that they are way more direct in the things they want to say. We felt that they didn’t care about how people react to their words even tough they might be nice people. We personally didn’t feel offended at all cause we know some Dutch people ourselves and know that the things they say aren’t meant to hurt people but rather to help them. For example when girl’s dress doesn’t look nice on her we mostly are to ashamed or to afraid to tell her directly and we might even lie and say she looks stunning. Dutch people on the other hand I felt like they just say what they think about it even tough the person they are talking to might get hurt in the process. This might cause some major conflicts between Dutch people and for example Chinese people where respect is very important.</p>
					
					<h3 id="h3artikel">Experience 2</h3>
					<p id="artikelparagrafen">My second experience was when I went to the ‘De Gentse Feesten’. I was partying with my friends but because there were to many people there I lost them in the crowd.
						 I just bought myself some new beverages but because of all the people I accidentaly spilled some of my beer on one of the girls. I wanted to appolagize and wipe of the spilled beer but all of the sudden her boyfriend starts yelling at me. I asked why he was so upset about the fact that I was just trying to be friendly and helpful.
						  It was a man from turkisch origin and said I looked at his girlfriend and then tried some very inappropriate things without asking. I explained the situation to which he replied pretty aggressively and told me he was even mad that I just looked at her. It escalated to a conflict which attracted a lot of his friends who wanted to start a fight. I knew I didn’t stand a chance because I lost my friends but even when I would win the conflict, violence is never an option. It makes everything worse but I think that in their culture looking at a girl without asking her or trying to get her attention without her asking is more offensive than ours. This can cause a lot of conflicts if the communication isn’t on point which it definitely wasn’t cause of the loud</p>
