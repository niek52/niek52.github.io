            <h2 id="secKeyheadersh">1. CROSS CULTURAL COMMUNICATION:</h2>

            <p id="secKeyheaders"><i>Content</i><br>
				In the webinair "Cross cultural communication" Pellegrino Riccardi explains the possible obstacles that can occur when people of different cultures communicate with each other. 
When one wants to communicate with other cultures one often starts trying to look at the other cultures but according to Pellegrino we have to approach this differently. According to him, we need to look at ourselves first and then at the rest. According to him it's all about perception, how we look at situations and act accordingly. 
Pellegrino comes from an English and Italian background and has worked in Norway. In all his years of traveling the world he has come into contact with many different cultures, people and nationalities. According to him, we should work with what you are passionate about and love to do, what you can excel at and enjoy putting all your energy into. He also advises us to do work that will have a positive impact on yourself and others. 
According to Pellegrino, people see what you want to see and they don't always see what you see yourself. Culture plays a big role in this. According to him, culture is a system of behavior that helps us act in an accepted and familiar way. For example, people from different cultures will handle the same situations differently and also describe the same things in different ways.
One of the challenges when one ends up in another culture is knowing how to behave there and what the customs are there. There are too many cultures with their own behaviors and customs to know them all. Therefore, it is helpful to find a way to learn about a new culture and to do so in such a respectful way. Many cultures take their behavior for granted because it is something that is familiar accepted to them. The skill of getting to know them in a good way is therefore essential, according to Pellegrino.
An example he uses to illustrate this is how cultures have different ways of waiting in a queue. In the UK everyone keeps the same order of queuing and thus respects the original order of queuing. However, this is not the case in Norway. When they open a new cash register there, everyone rushes to it because they apply the principle of "first come first serve". When we experience this for the first time and we do not see it as accepted and known, we can interpret this behavior as rude. However, this is the custom for the people of Norway and knowing this is essential to avoid confusion and conflict. To understand this behavior we need to know the culture more deeply and one will come to know the reason why they act that way. According to Pellegrino, the way of joining has to do with equality and it is not always easy to know that without directly judging the culture.
Every culture does the same things but a little bit differently. The way that works best according to Pellegrino is to act from curiosity. To wonder why people act in a certain way and to ask them questions based on curiosity is the best way, according to Pellegrino, to discover new cultures and their customs. 
When getting to know new cultures, it is important to remain curious even if it is not always easy and can sometimes lead to uncomfortable situations. For example, certain cultures tend to be closed, so it's not always easy to be non-judgmental and to keep opening up to them. 
Cultural differences are also reflected in how many words people use to express themselves, the "economy of language" as Pellegrino puts it. For example, one culture can describe a situation with 10 words and others manage to say it in 1 word. 
According to Pellegrino it's important to approach the behavior of cultures in a positive way and not always starting from what is accepted and known to you. This is because that behavior can be drastically different from other cultures and you should always try to get to know them in a curious way. 
The message Pellegrino wants to convey with his Ted Talk is that you should try to absorb the best of different cultures. By doing so you create a global mindset that allows you to communicate not only in your own culture but also cross culturally.
				<br><br><i>Reflection</i><br><br>
				I am personally someone who wants to explore as many different cultures as possible later on and do it in as respectful a way as possible. Just like Pellegrino told in his Ted Talk, it's not always that easy to know the customs of a particular culture. Finding a way that you can more easily navigate between the different customs and make sure that you are not making judgments is not always that easy. Thanks to this webinair, I found out that curiosity would apparently be the best approach to do so. Because of this I will certainly think back to this webinair in the future when I notice that I experience difficulties in understanding why people behave in a certain way and consequently can adapt as well as possible. From this webinair I especially take away that you shouldn't judge too quickly and approach things from a positive perspective instead of immediately thinking the worst.

			<h2 id="secKeyheadersh">2. HOW TO TRAVEL THE WORLD AS A DIGITAL NOMAD</h2>
	
            <p id="secKeyheaders"><i>Content</i><br>
				In the webinair "How to travel the world as a digital nomad" Ricky Shetty tells how he and other digital nomads can travel the world and how we can do the same. He does this using 3 steps that in the process will also create a positive impact on the world. 
Ricky Shetty is like most people an ordinary man, with a normal job and not from a rich background. He has not found a gap in the market but he has found a clever way to make his travel dreams, which so many have, come true. He calls himself a digital nomad, in other words someone who travels the world and makes money online.
From a young age, he wanted to see the world and never be based in 1 place, and he didn't see himself in the same nine-to-five job. However, he met his wife, had children and this caused him to fall into that scenario. This made him feel not quite happy because he could not make his travel dreams come true. This was until the moment he heard of the term "digital nomad". He immediately felt at home with the concept and wanted to become one himself.
With full support from his wife and children, he learned what exactly a digital nomad is and how they manage to make their dreams come true. He asked their questions and found that what they can do he can do too. 
According to Ricky, the first step to becoming a digital nomad is saving for your travels. He does this by putting aside a certain amount of money each month that he can spare. After all, saving money is also making money in his eyes. In addition to saving money, he is also a vlogger so he often gets sponsored for his travels and can stay in hotels for free. Another tip he gives is to apply the concept of "house sitting". This involves babysitting someone's house in exchange for a free place to stay.
The second step we can take to become a digital nomad ourselves is to sell. The most important thing we need to ask ourselves according to him is what we want to prioritize in our lives, material things or experiences. Do we want the latest iPhone or do we think our current cell phone is still good enough and are we going to invest this money in the next trip. According to him, we can sell all material things and use the proceeds to travel around. Nowadays you can learn many things online and in turn sell them.
The last but perhaps the most important step, is to help others as a digital nomad. What is the reason you travel the world? You can do it for yourself but is the travel worth it? The biggest reasons Ricky became a digital nomad is to explore different cultures but also to give something back to others. A recommended way to do this is volunteering for example. 
So don't just travel for yourself but also for others.
				<br><br><i>Reflection</i><br>
				This webinair has shown me that in an innovative way you can make your dreams come true if you want it enough. Sometimes you have to dare to go for it completely and also dare to take the necessary steps. Personally, I think experiences are more important than material things and I try to seize the opportunities that arise. I do not have the intentions to become a digital nomad but I do want to explore as many cultures as I can. Ricky Shetty has shown me a way and given some useful tips that I can apply when I want to make my travel dreams come true. This webinair didn't have that big of an impact on me but it did make me realize that we shouldn't always think that it would be too late to make your dreams come true. I notice in my private life that I often hear people say that they have not been able to make their dreams come true but where there is a will there is a way. However, this webinair did give me a great example of someone who found themselves in such a situation and was able to successfully turn it around.

			<h2 id="secKeyheadersh">3. MOETEN WE BANG ZIJN VOOR DE STAD VAN DE TOEKOMST</h2>

            <p id="secKeyheaders"><i>Content</i><br>
				In the webinair "should we be afraid of the city of the future" Professor Ballon, communication scientist, explains to us what the city of the future will look like. In doing so, he explains what we can expect and why communication scientists will play an essential role in the future of the city.
Today, almost everyone lives in the city because there are only a handful of municipalities in Belgium that are not urban areas. However, Belgium is not the only country where urbanization is dominant, but all over the world the urban model is growing very strongly. As a result, the rural model is increasingly being left behind and the population in these cities is set to increase enormously. Brussels, for example, is expected to gain 120,000 inhabitants in the next few years. 
One would think that this growth of cities is not a good sign, but it is just the opposite. The more inhabitants a city gets, the better it functions. People are going to be much more efficient with infrastructure and space and they are going to be much more dynamic. In a city that is larger you need on average fewer meters of internet cable and sewerage per person than in a smaller city or than in a rural area. In addition to working more efficiently, a city will also create more wealth. One that doubles in size will increase average income by 15 to 20 percent.

Besides the positive effects of growing cities, it also brings negative things. For example, crime, infections, traffic jams and the number of traffic accidents will increase. Traffic jams in themselves alone cause 15 billion euros of damage annually. 
So one is faced with a dilemma. On the one hand, cities continue to grow, which is very efficient, and on the other hand, this means that at some point they will become uninhabitable. According to Ballon, in order to ensure that the growth of cities will have mostly positive consequences, it is important to have very strong ICT. To make the negative consequences of a growing city manageable, you must always know what is happening everywhere. This amount of information must be processed correctly and communicated back to those who must be able to intervene if necessary. 
To achieve this, Ballon speaks of the "smart city". This is a city that uses the various ways of obtaining information and processing it. For example, one can use smart cameras and sensors that, for example, map out a city's entire sewer network and make sure they don't overflow. Another example given by Ballon is the private app Waze. This collects the GPS information of its various users and thus lets them know where traffic jams are occurring. Nowadays, one can extract information from almost anywhere and process it to contribute to the smart city. In this way, the environment is becoming smarter and smarter and one gets more and more information.
To achieve this, one goes through four stages. First, there is monitoring, the smart objects will collect the data. Then there is monitoring, one can intervene and take actions based on this data. Thirdly, there is optimization and making sure that predictions can be made so that, for example, you can predict the traffic jams of the next day. And finally, autonomy will be promoted: the smart objects will be so smart that they can determine and adjust their own behavior. An example that Ballon gives about autonomy is today's self-driving cars. 
So it is very important that people start to develop these smart technologies and learn to use them. They are ways to counteract the negative effects of a growing city and also make them manageable. All this ensures that a city will function better but also brings with it some dangers. At a certain point, one collects such an amount of information that it starts to get scary. By this Ballon means mainly concerning the privacy of the inhabitants of a city. 
However, thanks to communication scientists, one can make some predictions that can reassure us whether we should go with the technological advancement or rather counter it for privacy. Indeed, it is said that it is rather a shift from the dominant communication media. It is a new way of communication, as it were.
In addition to making predictions, communication sciences can point us to the dangers. The first problem that arises is dominance of platforms. By this Ballon means that when we are on the threshold of a new communication technology, one company will form a monopoly of it. This can have major consequences and even take over entire cities, as past experience has shown. However, one can arm oneself against this by intervening and controlling it as a government. 
A second problem that may arise is privacy and that the data could be used against us. People do not always think enough about the long term and the consequences of their actions. Ballon illustrates this by the fact that nowadays people put certain things on Facebook without thinking about it because they simply want likes. To counter this problem, a government can impose some strict rules and thus arm people against themselves. 
A third aspect is the "filter bubble." This is a concept that occurs when one only gets the information that the people around them get. This causes things like Brexit and Donal Trump to arise. This can occur not only on social media but also in a smart city. For example, the software can misjudge you as a person. A consequence of this could be that if you have been behind fast food once, you will not get information about healthy food in the future. A consequence of this is that the smart city becomes a city where the population is divided into a number of groups. 
A fourth aspect with which communication sciences are concerned is the behavior of people on the latest technologies. For example, a new app such as Waze for cycling may cause Belgium to become as much a cycling country as the Netherlands. But just like positive consequences, it can also have negative consequences on people's behavior. 
According to Ballon, we should not be afraid of the city of the future but simply arm ourselves against the negative aspects that a city can bring. To do this, we must also be sure to take into account the human aspects and ensure that we are truly building a smart human city of the future.
				<br><br><i>Reflection</i><br>
				Personally, I live in the Flemish Ardennes and am living in Ghent. This allows me to experience the relative quietness of the countryside on the one hand and the bustle of the city on the other. It both has its advantages and disadvantages so before I looked at this webinair I didn't really fear for the future. The main thing I take away from this webinair is that I can feel confident that we are facing a positive future and that I can make a good contribution to the city of the future as an IT professional.

			<h2 id="secKeyheadersh">4. GOOD, BETTER, BEST: COMPETITIVE IT RESUME STYLES</h2>

            <p id="secKeyheaders"><i>Content</i><br>
				In the webinair "Good,better best" Bonnie Burk and Jasmine Flesher,2 recruiters at Integrisource, talk about the importance of building a good resume and how it affects your job opportunities. They talk about how a resume should be put together using some "do's and don'ts".
They begin the webinair with a quote from Muhammad Ali, specifically, "It's not bragging if you can back it up." By this they mean that you can be proud of what you can and have achieved as long as you can prove it and support it with facts. With this webinair Bonnie and Jasmine show the best practices to display this in a professional way on your resume.
Their job is to analyze different types of resumes on a daily basis and the same elements are always present. A good resume should include a summary of the skills, education and experience of the job seeker.
The first is a collection of skills that you have acquired throughout your career and education. It is best placed at the top of your resume because it is often an introduction to recruiters. It is best to do this in a bulleted list as numbering can cause confusion. This list includes your technical skills but also your soft skills. These skills can relate to the technical programs, languages, devices and or frameworks you have mastered. Often it is also a good idea to tailor this list to the job you are looking for so that it stands out to a recruiter. One way to do this is to list the relevant programs or languages. Your skills should also be reflected in your work experience by trying to convince recruiters of your capabilities. This is best done starting from your work experience.  
The second element that should always be present on a resume are the education you have received and the certifications you have acquired. 
Finally, it is important to include your work experiences on your resume and is an important part of your curriculum vitae. This gives a clear picture of your job responsibilities as well as the projects you have made alongside them.
According to Bonnie and Jasmine, a recruiter mainly deals with 3 types of resumes, namely the chronological resume, the functional one and the combination between the two. They always contain some common elements. For example, one always mentions personal info, work experience and skills. The order and format in which one displays these will determine the type of resume. The situation in which one finds oneself at the time will then in turn determine which type of resume one uses best as each type has its advantages and disadvantages. 
The chronological resume is the most popular and widely used format. This resume is the most accurate at representing your education and work experience.  It provides an easy-to-follow structure and allows the reader to get a clear picture of your career development.  This resume is suitable for entry-level jobs but also when one wants to choose a career path that requires very extensive experience. In addition, it also presents a good picture about how motivated you are and your ability to adapt to situations. However, opting for this resume also has its drawbacks. Namely, it gives a clear picture of when one was unemployed or if you have only worked for a company for a short period of time. This resume is also not suitable when one wants to change careers. This is because recruiters often look at what your last job was. A previous career that is very different from the one you are applying for may prevent you from being selected. Recruiters might reject you because you do not have experience in the right field.
When one wants to change careers it is best to use the functional resume. This often begins with the name, contact info and achievements after which one tells about his skills and strengths. Furthermore, a brief overview of that person's work experience is given, but not what position he held when.  Here the strengths and skills are highlighted and the focus is on the depth of experience. The focus is on the skills instead of the work experience. However, this prevents the reader from linking the skills to the positions in which they have been applied. Recruiters find it important to have proof that the job seeker can back up his statements regarding his skills with facts. In addition, the lack of data on a resume can cause confusion for the reader.
The last type of resume is a combination of the chronological and functional resume. Here one combines the major strengths without making sure that it overshadows that person's work experience. Here one displays the entire work experience and in this way one can highlight the strengths and skills of that person. In addition, it is very effective in showing transcending skills when one wants to change careers. However, like the other types, this resume can come with drawbacks. For example, it can make the resume look much more repetitive and make it harder to read. In addition, gaps in your employment are also much more visible due to the clear representation of your career.
Outside of looking for the right type of resume, it is also important that its formatting is in order. For example, it is best to put the titles in bold and not the text. It is also best to provide a space between your text and between each section. Using the same layout everywhere looks more professional and creates a calm and structured CV. Try to avoid using too many stylish dots, it should remain neutral and professional. Recommended fonts according to Bonnie and Jasmine are: Arial, Verdana, Trebuchet MS, Tahoma and Times New Roman. In which person one speaks in the resume is also important. For example, it is best to start from the first person and omit the pronoun. So instead of "I led a team of 10 people "it is better to say "Led a team of 10 people." Finally, it is also best to avoid spelling errors and leave out unnecessary or subjective things.
In a good resume, one also provides the hard and soft skills and knowing the difference between the two is crucial. Hard skills are skills you learned in school or gained through an experience. These include the software tools you can use or languages you master. Soft skills are at least as important and refer to everything that gives color to relationships with others.  These skills are harder to measure than the hard skills and are therefore often illustrated by example. They include the degree to which one can communicate or show leadership. 
				<br><br><i>Reflection</i><br>
				This webinair has ensured that I am better prepared to enter the job market and it will enable me to draw up more professional CVs. Before, I thought that a CV had a fixed format and requirements and I didn't always realize that you should also adapt it to the job you want to apply for. It also gave me a clearer idea of what a professional resume should look like and I know what the do's and dont's are. That way, in the future I can make sure that I keep my job opportunities as broad as possible. In addition, I am now able to draw up a resume from a recruiter's point of view. If I have to apply for a job later on, I will definitely think back to this webinair and try to follow the guidelines as well as possible.

			<h2 id="secKeyheadersh">5. WHO’S IN YOUR CLOUD</h2>

            <p id="secKeyheaders"><i>Content</i><br>
				In the webinair "Who's in your cloud" John Brunn explains the importance of securing the cloud environment and the obstacles you may face in doing so. Determining who has access to the cloud environment is therefore of great importance and a top security priority.
John is "head of security" and leads several mobile security startups through which he has encountered many problems and shares his expertise through this webinair.
The first problem one faces is that it is a "fast moving business" so it is not always easy to make sure everyone is up to speed with the latest trends and software. For example, when doing a cloud computing project in a company, most of the employees may not be familiar with the latest tools. It can also happen that when you are working on a project, new software comes on the market that can help you a whole lot better than the software you are currently working with. 
A second problem that information security can face is that networks and servers keep growing and decentralizing. This has its advantages but also its disadvantages. For one thing, decentralization ensures that not everything is dependent on 1 system or host. This is very advantageous because when one would work in a centralized way and that system would fail, the whole system would be down. With decentralization this is not the case but it is more difficult to distribute information to all hosts in a correct, safe and efficient way.
Third, there is often a lack of the right tools, budget and number of employees. Thus, one will almost always be left with a shortage of manpower or headcount. In addition, it often happens that the budget that was originally foreseen will not suffice and, in addition, the lack of the right tools will cause frustration and loss of time.  
Finally, the audit scope of companies continues to grow. This means that the amount of time and documents continues to increase in audits and this continues to increase the workload of information security. In addition, the GDPR has had a major impact on how audits are viewed. This is in stark contrast to a few years ago.
According to John, cloud computing is a way in which engineers have almost an infinite number of possibilities with respect to computing. One no longer has to run everything on one host and its capabilities but can connect different hosts and combine capabilities that way. 
But despite all these problems, how does one manage to stay afloat as a company? One common way according to John is a concept called "Shoehorns and Piggybacks." In this, one starts reusing systems and trying to find ways to apply them to their own use cases. This way, as a company, you can ask other companies to do the work for you but still have confidence in your own capabilities and your engineers.
Another very important aspect according to John is to know what your tools can do and be sure that they allow you to do everything you want. One of the things that are essential with regard to security is to be able to check when exactly a break-in has taken place on your system. Not all tools allow this and it is therefore important to be aware of this.  According to him it is therefore necessary that you are able to control where your logs go and that you have the possibility to look them up. His experience has taught him that systems often only keep the logs for a few weeks and you will have to look up the rest in some other way. But you can only do this if you use a tool that allows you to do this. Whether they can do this, he says, will also let you know what your confidence in that tool is and whether or not you should continue to use it. 
It is also, according to John, before one performs sensitive actions on your system, to check whether or not it is infected. One way to do this is by performing a double check (MFA /multiple access methods: Google authneticator).
In addition, John gave his opinion in the webinair on using open source tools. He feels that when it comes to configuring Linux correctly there is very good documentation available. However, the problem is the user management of the system. The more people use it the more complicated it becomes to send out changes to each host. However, he himself is in favor of open source tooling. We do need to check whether this software is kept up to date or not.  There are many good tools available but it has been a long time since they have been updated, because they can be so specific to a single problem. To simplify this process we should look for tools that run cross platform such as tools for Amazon. 
In addition, there may be problems related to licensing when using open source tools. To remedy this, you can try using free trials but paid software is also highly recommended.
				<br><br><i>Reflection</i><br>
				This webinair has given me a clearer picture of why people are becoming more and more in favor of using cloud computing and cloud-based network infrastructures. People are not always aware of what dangers come along with this and how we can guard against them. Thanks to John's expertise, I am now aware of these dangers and will be able to arm myself better against them if I end up in a security environment later on. I am personally in favor of using open source tools because one often gets better feedback from them. When in the future I notice that the tools I am working with are not efficient enough, maybe there are better tools available for that and I will save myself and my company a lot of time and frustrations. So thanks to this webinair I have a much better and clearer vision on how the market will move towards a cloud-based environment but also what disadvantages and obstacles this might bring.

			<h2 id="secKeyheadersh">6. A 12-YEAR-OLD APP DEVELOPER</h2>

            <p id="secKeyheaders"><i>Content</i><br>
				In the webinair "A 12-year-old app developer," Thomas Suarez explains how he single-handedly taught himself to develop applications for iPhone iPod Touch and IPad. His first app is a unique app called "Earth fortune counter". This shows the earth in different colors depending on what your luck is. But his most popular and famous app is "Bustin Jieber", a whack-a-mole game as a parody of Justin Bieber. 
Many people wonder how he managed to develop these apps and how best to get started if they want to learn these skills as well. Children love to play video games and would also like to learn how to develop them themselves but often don't know where to learn this. 
The way he approached this is by mastering the different programming languages like Python, C and Java so that he could master the basics. Then he learned to use the iPhone Software Development Kit and consequently released apps on the App Store including Earths Fortune Teller.  
He gets a lot of support from friends and family and Steve Jobs is a great inspiration to Thomas.
As an initiative, he has set up an app club at his school where any student can learn to devise an app in such a way that he can share his experiences with other students. With this he wants to facilitate the learning process and encourage young people to start building software and applications themselves. 
There are several programs on the market that help with this, such as the "iPad Pilot Program" that Thomas himself uses. This is a program that places apps on the App Store and offers those apps for free to local and other districts. The proceeds from these applications go entirely to the educational foundations so that more resources can be offered to those who want to learn to develop applications but do not know where to start.
Thomas feels that the resources available today are underutilized and that teachers need to recognize and utilize these resources more.
In the future, Thomas would like to develop more apps, he is partnering with another company for an app, wants to learn Android programming, continue his app club and most importantly continue to find ways to share knowledge with others.
				<br><br><i>Reflection</i><br>
				In this webinair, Thomas talks mainly about his learning process and how difficult it sometimes was. He notices that many children and young people want to learn how to do this themselves but don't know where to start. I myself have experienced this to some extent because during my education in secondary school I came into contact with relatively little IT-related material. When I started my own education, it was for a large part a leap in the dark because it was not offered anywhere in my secondary school. From this webinair I will mainly take with me that when I see people in doubt whether they want to learn programming and development themselves I will give them extra explanations or try to help them where necessary. This is because I know that it is an industry that is generally seen as "difficult or complicated" with a difficult learning curve. This is true at first glance but the more you learn about this field, the more interesting it becomes and the easier the learning process is, like learning a new programming language. 
Finally, I will try to contribute more myself and try to help people with IT related problems such as thinking along on Stack Overflow. 
This is because I know that this helps me a lot when I am stuck with a problem and I want to do the same for other people and contribute to this.

			<h2 id="secKeyheadersh">7. THE SINGLE BIGGEST REASON WHY STARTUPS SUCCEED</h2>

            <p id="secKeyheaders"><i>Content</i><br>
				In the webinair "The single biggest reason why startups succeed" Bill Gross explains the biggest reasons why certain startups become successful and then again others do not. 
Bill has started many startups himself and has mentored many others. This made him wonder what causes some to succeed and others to flop. For this he based himself on data from hundreds of companies and ranked them on their five most important characteristics. The result of this was 1 characteristic that stood out and dazzled even him.
According to Bill, a startup is one of the best ways to improve the world. This is because when you take a group of people with equal shares and make them work together you can find an unprecedented human capacity. 
When starting his research, Bill believed that the Idea was the most decisive factor in making a startup succeed. Hence, he named his company "IdeaLab."
Then he began to think if there might not be other reasons and came up with the idea that execution, adaptability or the team might not play a big role and might be more important than the idea itself.  The capacity of the team to deal with setbacks and to overcome obstacles. 
Third, he considered what impact the business plan would have on the success of a startup. How will a company ensure that they generate income. 
Fourth, it is important that a company can finance its activities and how they do so. In some companies there is huge investment but why is it that they do not always manage to blossom into successful companies.
And finally, he wondered what influence timing could have. When do people decide to enter the market with their company and how big would this influence their success? You can come too early as a company which means you have to educate the world about your products and they are not ready. You can come too late which means there are too many competitors in the market or you can come at the right time. 
Basing himself on these five factors, Bill concluded that the single most important factor was timing. Timing explained 42 percent of the success or failure of a company, then the Team, then the Idea, then the business model and finally the funding.
To base this on fact, Bill uses several examples where timing was perfect. Airbnb came out just after a financial crisis. Uber came out when drivers needed extra money and YouTube came out when people were able to stream video in an easy way. YouTube had a business model but did not know it would succeed however the timing allowed them to grow into a successful company.
The message that Bill wants to convey with his TedTalk is that the idea is important, the execution maybe even more important but the most important thing may be the timing. We should not only look to see if we have found a gap in the market and can execute it but that we should also look carefully to see if the customers are ready for what you want to sell.
				<br><br><i>Reflection</i><br>
				When I would like to start a startup myself later on I will definitely think back to this webinair. Whenever I will come up with a new idea for my business, I will ask myself if the market is ready for my product before I will develop my idea further. This because it now appears that timing is one of the most important factors you will have to consider when you want your business to blossom into a success. Before I watched this webinair I thought like Bill that the idea is the most important factor, like finding a gap in the market, but now it turns out that this is not always the case.
Another way this webinair has influenced me in part is how I will try to come up with ideas for new businesses later on. For example, instead of simply looking at what products don't yet exist in the market, you could look at what products are currently in high demand in the market. That way, the timing of your products that you want to sell will be better than if you simply look for what products are missing from the market. I would then do this by keeping a close eye on the latest trends and in that way be a part ahead of the competition.

			<h2 id="secKeyheadersh">8. CULTURAL DIFFERENCE IN BUSINESS</h2>

            <p id="secKeyheaders"><i>Content</i><br>
				In the webinair "Cultural differences in business" Valerie Hoeks explains the biggest cultural differences between Europe and China and the importance of understanding and respecting them. 
Valerie studied sinology, the study of China and all fields related to it, at Leiden University and has been active in China for more than 10 years as a traveler, student and entrepreneur. From the first moment she set foot on Chinese soil she knew for sure that it would not be just one visit and she wants to share her experiences with the world through her Ted Talk. She feels that the Western world often has the wrong idea about Chinese culture.
One of the cultural differences between Europe and China is how highly relationships are valued by the Chinese people. Valerie thinks that we can learn a lot from this and that this is one of the most fascinating concepts applied there. But why is this so important?
In China, people live by the sayings of a man named Confucius. His words are like the Bible to the Chinese and are still listened to. In fact, he thinks it is very important to have respect for the elders and to have mutual respect. There are several in which one shows this in their behavior. Thus, it is important to build relationships in order to become successful in China.
"Guanxi," which literally means connections or relationships, is the way people do things in China. For example, trust is very difficult to obtain but once you obtain it, it is wonderful to see. People will always be there to help you and the Chinese are one of the most loyal people Valerie has ever seen in her life. 
People in China also live by a set of requirements that they must follow in order to function in Chinese culture. 
Thus, one applies the concept of returning favors. The more you do for someone, the more that person must do back for you. Thus, one creates a constant circle of favors that is very important to respect among the Chinese. Therefore, failing to return those favors is like sacrilege to them. 
Valerie illustrates this with an example and which also demonstrates a great cultural difference between China and Europe. We as Westerners often do not remember which teachers we had in primary and secondary school. However, this is a big difference with China, there people still visit their teachers for tea to thank them for teaching. This is one of the many ways people apply the concept of returning the favor. 
One of the first times Valerie had to work with Chinese people she had the impression that they were fairly lazy but this is a misconception that people often have. They are not lazy but it is important to wait for the right moment. For example, they don't often go and do something when it doesn't feel right. According to Valerie, it is important to understand this in order to avoid conflict that way. 
Last and perhaps most important to the Chinese is the concept of "face." For example, making a mistake in public is one of the most embarrassing things that can happen to someone. Your social status is determined by your face and has a great influence on how successful you are or can become. You can earn face but you can also lose it. 
The message Valerie wants to give is that we can learn a lot from different cultures and that it is important to know the differences well. This a big influence on business relationships and the success of your business with other cultures like China for example? 
				<br><br><i>Reflection</i><br>
				In my personal life, I often notice that there are quite a lot of prejudices about the Chinese people and this is partly because we often don't know much about them outside of when they get negative media coverage. If I'm honest I also had these especially now with the current situation over, from, before the corona crisis. This will not have a positive impact on most people's perception of the Chinese. However, this webinair made me realize that you should not be too quick to judge their culture and that some of the things we think about them are just a misinterpretation of their customs. For example, they are generally shy and it takes a long time to earn their trust but we can see this as if they are unfriendly. Therefore, in the future I will have a better view of their habits and try to be more open to other cultures. Valerie also showed this especially in her Ted Talk that this is essential if you want to work well with different cultures.

			<h2 id="secKeyheadersh">9. THE HAPPY SECRET TO BETTER WORK</h2>

            <p id="secKeyheaders"><i>Content</i><br>
				In the webinair "The happy secret to better work" they talk about positive psychology. Nowadays people see the world mostly in a negative way instead of in a positive way. Thus, more often than not, the glass is half empty and the grass is greener on the other side. People often think you have to be successful to be happy and can never really be happy. This is because one shifts one's goals of success, if you have a certain income then you must have a higher income, if you have made certain sales then you shift the numbers. As a result, one constantly strives for the next achievement and never achieves success and never happiness.
According to the webinair, we should reverse the formula and be happy in the now. That way we are going to be happy in the long run just as we are in the short run. The way most people strive for happiness now is in the long run so the way to it is not seen as happy. In reversing the formula, we achieve happiness faster in the short term and also in the long term. 
It is also scientifically proven that when one is happy or feels happy we can make the brain work better and 31% faster. In this way, work is done in a more pleasant, efficient way and work is not just seen as a way to achieve a certain long-term goal and become happy. 
If we work in this way, we will change the world and the external factors in it as well. According to the webinair, this is how we can start a revolution and how schools can help. Currently, people mainly take a look at the negative things and the positive things are more easily overlooked. To illustrate this with an example, the medical sector will learn to show conditions that you have certain symptoms and not those that you do not have. In addition, one will be pointed out more often for poor school results than for the positive ones. One is more likely to look at what one cannot do, does not do, or has not achieved than at what the student does succeed in.
				<br><br><i>Reflection</i><br>
				This webinair has a positive influence on my view on how I look at situations. For example, in the future I will try to look at certain events more from a positive angle. When an obstacle arises I will try to approach it in a different way.  I will not always dwell on a particular achievement long enough and will always try to find the next thing I am striving for. 
I will try to enjoy more the little things that make me happy because I personally find that I don't always do that enough either. I always wanted to do a job later that I love and now I am even more convinced that I want to keep this vision of life. This because it turns out that being happy with what you have is the fastest way to become happy. In addition, I will perform even better so will have a positive impact on my professional career as well.
After watching this webinair, I am going to try to appreciate things a little longer and also be more happy with what I have and not constantly strive for what I don't have. I will try to apply this in my personal life as well as in my future career. 
I will try to encourage people to do the same and thus also focus more on being happy in the now. The fact that it has been scientifically proven that the brain works 31% faster and more efficiently when one feels happy has also convinced me to apply this. I think everyone tries to be or become happy and that way we reach happiness faster and longer so I will definitely try to use this.

			<h2 id="secKeyheadersh">10. HOW GREAT LEADERS INSPIRE ACTIONS</h2>

            <p id="secKeyheaders"><i>Content</i><br>
				In the webinair "How great leaders inspire actions" they explain why it is that companies like Apple have become successful and others have not. However, Apple has the same resources in the world to promote their products and offer their USP(unique selling point). 
We can recognize a similar pattern in all successful companies in a competitive market and that their marketing is drastically different from other less successful companies. In webinair they explain this using the "Golden Circle". 
When most companies promote their products they start from the outside, the what, and work their way in , the why. To make this clear I will illustrate this with an example. 	
If Apple were to think like any other company, their marketing message would sound like this: "We make great computers."(the what) "They are user-friendly, beautifully designed and easy to use."(the how) "Would you like to buy one"(the why). However, this will not be as good a marketing strategy as it would be if one worked in reverse.  Dis is however how most market strategies run now. They say what they do, how they do it and why they do it. A better strategy that all inspiring companies use is to work from the inside of the Golden Circle to the outside. Then Apple's marketing message could sound like this, "Everything we do is a result of what we believe in(the why). How we do this is by building beautifully designed computers that are easy to use(the how). By coincidence, they are great computers(the what)." 
The big difference in which some companies can become successful and others cannot is not because of what resources they have at their disposal but because they come to market with a different, inspiring vision. For example, they are not just going to sell their products but it is important to them that people buy their products for the vision behind them. For example, they want to pioneer a new trend in the market. For example, people bought Steve Jobs his first Apple smartphone not because they believed in his product but rather Jobs his vision. They wanted to be the first and so market research has shown that the pioneers and early adopters are one of your most important customers when you want to launch a new product in the market. They will fully support you and recommend your product to other people. This is essential because the majority of your customers will only buy a product when it has already been tested and approved by other people. They illustrate this using a chart where they show that one must pass a certain threshold that will become the tipping point to become successful in the marketplace. They call this the "Law of diffusion of innovation". In order for a product to succeed it is very important to convince people of your beliefs, for example, you are going to change the world with your product and it would be a shame if they were not on board with the latest trend. Proving that your product will succeed is less important. 
Thus, it is better to convince people and make them believe in you. This way later on you will also not have to stick to 1 product but you can also do market differentiation and differentiation. Because they believe in your company you will also be able to sell your future products to them. For example, Apple was able to move into laptops in addition to selling smartphones. People buy it not just because it is functionally the best laptop but because it is an Apple laptop.
				<br><br><i>Reflection</i><br>
				This webinair also backs up the facts with real data so that I can say with certainty that this pattern effectively occurs in successful businesses. That way I can be sure that this will have a positive influence should I set up a company in the future and apply this strategy. Thanks to this webinair, I will immediately have an advantage over those who do not know or use this strategy.
I can apply this way of thinking and communicating not only to products I want to sell but also in everyday life. For example, I will try to use this strategy when I want to convince people of my views. Consequently, I will try to express my opinion in a different way and as a result be able to argue better. I will not so much start from what should happen (the what), then how this should happen (the how) and why (the why), but rather the reverse order. So I will say why something has to change, how we should do this and what the result will be. In this way I will try to work towards the result instead of starting from the result. 
I believe that applying this new way of thinking will yield positive results and I am very glad I watched this webinair. It was a very informative experience that will reflect in my daily life but will also influence my future business decisions.
